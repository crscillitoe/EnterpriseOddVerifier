# EnterpriseOddVerifier

## Have you ever thought to yourself:

Gee, I sure wish I could call `.isOdd` on any and all objects/non-objects I define in my Javascript code.

## Look no further.

Here at EnterpriseOddVerifier Co., we have been hard at work developing an enterprise grade library that guarantees reliability, performance, efficiency, useability, modularity, extensibility, and any other word that ends in the letter `y`.

Using the library is **_simple_**. Simply run `npm install enterprise-odd-verifier`
